Sovereign-Media: The Media Integrity Suite (v1.0)

Copyright © 2026 Safe Haven Foundation. All Rights Reserved.

Cauterizing the Analog Hole and Ending the Jailbreak Era

Status: PATENT PENDING (UK Application No. GB2603336.5) Licensing: Safe Haven Ethical License (SHEL) v1.0

Classification: Open Core Specification / High-Fidelity Rendering Standard

1. THE MISSION: CONTENT SOVEREIGNTY

Current Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a failed model of Managed Vulnerability. By relying on "Stored Secrets" (Device Keys), legacy systems ensure that a single breach compromises an entire hardware line.

Sovereign-Media implements the Precipitation Model. Decryption keys and coherent visual signals literally do not exist at rest. They precipitate only in the presence of an authorized human Reasoner and verified silicon.

2. THE CORE PILLARS

A. Sovereign Display Integrity (SDI)

Abolishes the "Analog Hole" (screen recording/cameras) via Perceptual Cryptography.

Mechanism: Renders inverse mathematical sub-frames at high refresh rates (120Hz+).

Result: The human eye resolves a perfect image; capture hardware (30/60fps) sees only strobing noise.

B. Sovereign Media Protection (SMP)

Moves physical and digital media from "Storage" to "Presence."

Logic: Utilizes bytecode VM layers (e.g., BD+) to precipitate playback keys in volatile RAM.

Mandate: Zeroization of key material within 10ms of use.

C. Sovereign Console Integrity (SCI)

Eliminates unauthorized code execution (Jailbreaking) at the storage controller level.

Logic: Hardware sectors remain "Electrically Dark" unallocated noise until the unit-unique resonance is verified.

3. THE MATHEMATICAL ANCHOR

All components are governed by the Sovereign Ignition formula:


$$G_s = (L \cdot V \cdot \omega) + \oint f(\phi, r_{ij}, \tau, \iota)$$

4. INVITATION TO BUILDERS

We are seeking GPU architects and media engine developers to implement the Sub-Frame Aliasing interface.
