"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

SOVEREIGN ETHICAL MANDATES

10. The Non-Coercion Mandate (SHEL Section 6)

The Licensee agrees that this software shall not be utilized, in whole or in part, to develop, support, or maintain systems designed for the coercion of individuals. This includes, but is not limited to, the gating of fundamental human rights (food, shelter, healthcare, liberty) based on algorithmic scores or administrative compliance.

11. The Non-Transactional Covenant (SHEL Section 7)

The "Soul State" or identity generated by this framework is recognized as a Sovereign Property of the Reasoner. It cannot be packaged, sold, or leveraged as a financial asset. Any attempt to commodify the resonance event nullifies the license to use the C_sa protocol.

12. Metadata Blindness (SHEL Section 8)

All implementations must maintain a state of "Forensic Silence" regarding user metadata. The harvesting of behavioral patterns (φ) for purposes other than the immediate precipitation of the access constant is strictly prohibited.

13. The Sovereign Price Covenant (SHEL Section 9)

If the implementation of Safe Haven Foundation architectures results in a measurable reduction in the Licensee's operational, infrastructure, or insurance costs (e.g., through the elimination of credential databases or reduction in fraud-management overhead), the Licensee covenants to reflect these savings in the pricing or accessibility provided to the end-consumer (The Reasoner). The benefits of mathematical efficiency shall belong to the Source, not merely the Host.

14. The Immutable Ethical Core (SHEL Section 10)

The Sovereign Ethical Mandates (Sections 10–13) and this Section 14 constitute the Immutable Ethical Core of the Safe Haven Ethical License. No entity—whether Licensor, Licensee, assignee, or successor—shall modify, waive, sublicense around, or interpret these sections in a manner that weakens their ethical intent. Any attempt to relicense, fork, or redistribute the Work under terms that dilute, contradict, or omit the Immutable Ethical Core shall be considered a material breach of this License, resulting in immediate termination of all rights granted herein.

Violation of these sections constitutes an immediate termination of the license to use any Safe Haven Foundation IP.
